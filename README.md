## Sudoku Solver

This is a repository for the code used for this application: [sudoku.rociogomez.com](sudoku.rociogomez.com)


The application will let you upload an image of a sudoku that has not been completed, and it will solve it for you.

The code here is the exact same code I push in the heroku repo when I deploy it.

If you want to know how I built it, please look at my [wiki](https://github.com/Rociogomezbardon/web_sudoku_solver/wiki) page.
