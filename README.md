## Sudoku Solver

This is a repository for the code used for this application: sudoku.rociogomez.com or at sudoku-web-application.heroku.com


The application will let you upload an image of a sudoku that has not been completed, and it will give you a solution of the sudoku.

The code here is the exact same code I push in the heroku repo when I deploy it.

If you want to know how I built it, please look at my [wiki]https://github.com/Rociogomezbardon/web_sudoku_solver/wiki) page.
